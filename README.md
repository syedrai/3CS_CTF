🧭 How to Join

Create a team in your group/Discord/WhatsApp and choose a team name.

Click the Index Link (shared by organizer) to access the Drive folder with all challenges.

Forensics — medium (100 pts)

Miscellaneous / Stego — medium (65–150 pts)

Total points vary by challenge; check each README for the exact value.

🚦 Flag Format & Submission Rules

All flags follow this format: 3CS{...} (case-sensitive).

Submit flags using the challenge-specific prefilled Google Form link found inside each challenge’s Drive folder.

Only the first correct submission per team per challenge is scored. Duplicate correct submissions will not increase your score.

If a flag is accidentally leaked or a challenge is broken, organizers reserve the right to modify scoring or disable the challenge.

📝 Hints Policy

Hints are available on request and are controlled by the organizers.

Each challenge folder contains hint1.txt and hint2.txt files, but they are private by default. To request a hint, message the event staff (Discord/WhatsApp).

Organizers may charge a small point penalty for revealing a hint (optional; state if you will do this).

⚖️ Scoring & Leaderboard

Points are awarded per challenge according to its value (shown in README).

The leaderboard updates automatically in the shared Google Sheet as correct flags are verified.

Tiebreakers: fewer total submissions wins; if still tied, earlier time of last correct submission wins.

🛡️ Code of Conduct & Anti-Cheat

Play fair: no sharing of flags between teams, no distributed brute forcing of services, and no attacking the hosting or infrastructure.

If you need clarification, ask the organizers — we’ll decide if a challenge is broken and announce fixes.

Evidence requests: Organizers may ask for a screenshot/proof for suspicious quick solves.

Violations may result in disqualification.

⚙️ Technical Notes for Players

Use your browser developer tools (F12), Wireshark (for PCAP), CyberChef, Python, or local tools to solve challenges.

For PCAP challenges: use Wireshark (filters like http and ftp are helpful).

For decoding: base64, xor, rot13 and other standard decoders will help.

If a challenge has downloadable files, get them from the Drive folder (viewer access is provided).

🧾 Admin Notes (for organizers)

Keep an AnswerKey sheet with all correct flags and point values — use it to auto-validate submissions.

Use prefilled Google Form links to make submissions challenge-specific.

Monitor the responses sheet and the leaderboard for erroneous or duplicate scoring.

Be ready to reveal hints by toggling Drive file sharing or DMing hints privately.

If you plan to collect money, distribute a registration code to paid teams and require it for form submission (or hand out codes after payment).

💬 Communication & Support

Discord: [insert server invite] — use #ctf-help for questions and #ctf-announcements for official messages.
